# LPP 2 JS

LPP 2 JS is a translator for the language LPP to 
JavaScript. It's written using Kotlin and ANTLR.

To view the output, copy the program printed in the console
add paste in a Javascript formatter 
[like this one](build/libs/kotlin-interpreter-0.1.jar), or you can just
paste it in you favorite code editor and format the document to see
the generated code more clearly.

To run it, it's necessary to have a local JavaScript runtime like Node.js or Deno 
and then run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
node compiledCode.js
```
